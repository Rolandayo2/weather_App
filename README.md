# Weather App

Welcome to the Weather App repository! This simple web application allows you to check the weather in different cities. It's a great way to learn about web development and working with APIs.

## Features

- **Search by City**: Enter the name of a city, and the app will fetch and display its current weather information.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling the page to make it look good.
- **JavaScript**: Making the page interactive and fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Replace `'API_KEY'` in the `script.js` file with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
